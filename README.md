# Water Usage Web App
This application provides the ability for a user to track their daily water usage at home. It does that by allowing the user to add new usage data on a daily basis and then also provides a dashboard overview of usage history.

## How to run the app via a web browser
Before running the app on a local machine please ensure that the [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/) application is installed, together with NPM and [GIT](https://git-scm.com/).

Once that is done please follow these steps:

```
cd into folder of choice on computer
git clone <repo url>
cd into folder water_usage
run npm install
npm run dev
```

If the project has successfully built, the command prompt screen should provide a localhost URL which can be used in a web browser, e.g [http://localhost:8085](http://localhost:8085)
